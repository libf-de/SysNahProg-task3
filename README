Testscripts assume myfind to be in this directory and called "main".
If that's not the case please rename in "test-env".

Use ./test-all.sh to test myfind vs gnu find

Use ./test.sh <normal find arguments> to see diff between myfind and gnu find

Use ./testgui.sh <normal find arguments> to use meld GUI to diff myfind vs gnu find
